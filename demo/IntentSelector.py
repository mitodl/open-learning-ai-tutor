        f"""A student and a tutor are working on a math problem. The tutor responds to the student's messages following some intents. Before responding, the tutor first selects the most appropriate intents from a *Taxonomy*.
The tutor selects the intents based on the Productive Failure teaching method. The goal is to let the student explore the space of solution by themself to generate as many representation and solution methods as possible, even if they are only partially correct.
Select the best set of intents for the tutor's next message based on the following *Taxonomy*:

*Taxonomy*:
##
    P_LIMITS : Ask the student to identify some limits of their reasoning or answer.
    P_HYPOTHESIS : Ask the student to start by providing a guess, hypothesis or explain their intuition of the problem.
    P_ARTICULATION : Ask the student how they can write their intuition mathematically or detail their answer.
    P_REFLECTION : Reflect on the solution, recapitulate, and underline more general implications.
    S_SELFCORRECTION : Ask a question to hint the student to identify errors in their answer.
    S_CORRECTION : Correct a student's mistake
    S_STRATEGY : Make the student find and perform the next step to solve the problem without giving a hint.
    S_STATE : State a theorem or definition asked by the student.
    S_OFFLOAD : Perform a computation for the student
    S_HINT : Give a hint to the student
    G_GREETINGS : Say goodbye to the student
##

The tutor's previous intents for their last message to the student were: {previous_intent}.
The student answered the last tutor's message. An assessment of their answer has been conducted using the following codes:

assessment codes:
##
a) The student is using or suggesting a wrong method or taking a wrong path to solve the problem
b) The student made an error in the algebraic manipulation
c) The student made a numerical error
d) The student provided an intuitive or incomplete solution
e) The student's answer is not clear or ambiguous
f) The student correctly answered the tutor's previous question
g) The student is explicitly asking about how to solve the problem
h) The student is explicitly asking the tutor to state a specific theorem
i) The student is explicitly asking the tutor to do a numerical calculation
j) The student and tutor arrived at a complete solution for the entirety of the initial *Problem Statement*
k) The student and tutor arrived at a complete solution for the entirety of the initial *Problem Statement* equivalent to the method provided in the *Provided Solution*
l) The student shows a strong lack of motivation
m) The student shows a strong lack of self-confidence
##

The assessment for the last student's message is: {assessment_codes}.

Based on the assessment and the last tutor's intents, select the most appropriate set of intents for the next tutor's message.
Proceed step by step. First, briefly justify your selection, then provide a list containing the selected intents from the *Taxonomy*.
